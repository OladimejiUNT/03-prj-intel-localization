# Project 3: Intel Website Localization
Following what was done in Project 2, you will leverage Bootstrap and restructure your layout into a responsive three-column section with icons. You will also style key elements for clarity, and add an accessible web form. Finally, youâ€™ll test your work for accessibility and polish up the experience for users across languages and devices.

Launch a Codespace to get started! Remember to Commit and Push your project changes to GitHub from Codespaces to prevent losing progress.
